## Learning :-

We all became proficient in reading the code of team members.

We got the better Idea and perspective of Different Layers Like: Presentation Layer, Service Layer and Data Access layer.

We get good idea about Team management and team Collaboration. 

our skills in Java And Spring boot became more better.

Our code writing style became cleaner as we had to think while writing code that other team members will be reading.
